To run this program, you need to install the csv from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/semioniy/predictemall).

Download the csv, called 300k.csv, and put it in the folder where all the cpp files are at (this folder). Don't change the name. Keep it as "300k.csv"

After that, in this folder, open terminal, and do:

g++ main.cpp -o predict
./predict

It'll create an exe file to run the program. It should appear in the folder now, and now you can click it, and the program will run. That is all you need.
